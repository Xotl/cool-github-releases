# Usage
This action supports 3 modes: `download`, `update`, `delete`.
A common use is to create releases or to get assets from a release, here are some examples:

### Download assets from a release
```yaml
      - name: Download asset README.md from release with tag v3.0.0 
        uses: Xotl/cool-github-releases@v1
        with:
          mode: download
          tag_name: v3.0.0
          assets: README.md
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
```

Let's see what the options means:
> **mode** - Indicates that we want to download assets. If no mode is specified, default value is `download`.  
> **tag_name** - Indicates that we want to download from a release with the tag `v3.0.0`.  
> **assets** - Indicates that we want the asset with the name `README.md` to be downloaded at the current working directory.  
> **github_token** - A valid github token. For releases you can use the one created for the workflow.  

Here's another example:
```yaml
      - name: Download assets README.md & LICENCE from release with tag A-fancy-tag 
        uses: Xotl/cool-github-releases@v1
        with:
          assets: README.md;LICENSE|myFolder/myLicense.txt
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
```
> **mode** - Since the default value is `download` we don't need pass any mode if we want to dowload assets.  
> **tag_name** - If we don't specify a tag then the latest release will be used to download assets.  
> **assets** - Indicates that we want to download the assets with name `README.md` & `LICENSE` in that release, but the asset `LICENSE` will be downloaded at `myFolder/myLicense.txt`.  
> **github_token** - A valid github token. For releases you can use the one created for the workflow.  

### Create a release and upload assets
```yaml
      - name: It should create a release with assets README.md and LICENCE 
        uses: Xotl/cool-github-releases@v1
        with:
          mode: update
          tag_name: v3.0.0
          body_mrkdwn: "### It works!\n Wow, it worked like a charm ðŸŽ‰"
          assets: myFolder/README.md
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
```

Let's see what the options means:
> **mode** - Indicates that we want to create or edit a release. If a release with that tag already exists it will be updated.  
> **tag_name** - Indicates that we want to create a release with the tag `v3.0.0`. If a release with that tag already exists it will be updated instead.  
> **body_mrkdwn** - The description of the release will be a nice formated markdown: `### It works!\n Wow, it worked like a charm ðŸŽ‰`.  
> **assets** - The file at `myFolder/README.md` will be uploaded to that release.  
> **github_token** - A valid github token. For releases you can use the one created for the workflow.  

Here's another example:
```yaml
      - name: It should create a release with assets README.md and LICENCE 
        uses: Xotl/cool-github-releases@v1
        with:
          mode: update
          isPrerelease: true
          tag_name: v3.0.0
          release_name: "My Release"
          body_mrkdwn: "### It works!\n Wow, it worked like a charm ðŸŽ‰"
          assets: myFolder/README.md;LICENSE|text/plain;
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
```

> **mode** - Indicates that we want to create or edit a release. If a release with that tag already exists it will be updated.  
> **isPrerelease** - Our release will be flagged as a prerelease.  
> **tag_name** - Indicates that we want to create a release with the tag `v3.0.0`. If a release with that tag already exists it will be updated instead.  
> **release_name** - The release will have the name `My Release` instead of the tag.  
> **body_mrkdwn** - The description of the release will be a nice formated markdown: `### It works!\n Wow, it worked like a charm ðŸŽ‰`.  
> **assets** - Will upload files `myFolder/README.md` & `LICENSE` to the release, but since the `LICENSE` file doesn't have an extension associated to a [MIME type][] we need to specify it, in this case the [MIME type][] is `text/plain`.  
> **github_token** - A valid github token. For releases you can use the one created for the workflow.

# Reference
The required inputs will vary depending on the selected `mode`.

There are only 3 valid values: `download`, `update`, `delete`. If no `mode` is provided then it will use the default value (default is `download`).


All modes require a valid `github_token`, commonly you can use the [one provided in the environment for your workflow][github_token]. In case you get some permissions error messages you will need to provide a token with more elevated privileges.

<br/>

## Mode: `download` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
âš   _This is the default mode if no mode is specified._  

Use this mode to download assets from an existant release. 

### Inputs:

* ### `assets` _(required)_ <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
  > <asset_expresion>[;<asset_expresion>...;<asset_expresion>]  
  >   
  > <asset_expresion> := <asset_name>  
  > <asset_expresion> := <asset_name>|<file_path>  
  > * **asset_name** - Name of the asset in the release that you will see under asset section in a release at the Github page.  
  > * **file_path** - A valid path where the asset will be downloaded.  

  A string indicating the assets that you want to download. You can get one asset, multiple assets or even specify a download path.

  The character `;` is the separator for different asset names and a `|` character after an asset name indicates the path in which the asset will be downloaded.


  #### Examples:
  * Single asset:
    ```yaml
    assets: README.md # Will download asset README.md at the current working directory
    ```
  * Single asset with different path
    ```yaml
    assets: README.md|myFolder/README.md # Will download asset README.md at myFolder/README.md 
    ```
    ```yaml
    assets: README.md|myFolder/another_name.md # Will download asset README.md at myFolder/another_name.md 
    ```
  * Multiple assets
    ```yaml
    # Will download assets README.md, myfile.zip and cat.png at the current working directory 
    assets: README.md;myfile.zip;cat.png
    ```
  * Multiple assets with different path/name
    ```yaml
    # Will download 3 assets:
    #     - Asset with name myfile.zip will be downloaded at myFolder/myfile.zip
    #     - Asset with name cat.png will be downloaded at the current working directory
    #     - Asset with name logo.svg will be downloaded at myFolder/something.svg
    assets: myfile.zip|myFolder/myfile.zip;cat.png;logo.svg|myFolder/something.svg
    ```
* ### `releaseId` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
  You can provide a release id instead of a tag. If you pass `releaseId` the input `tag_name` will be ignored.  
  **Note:** If no `releaseId` nor `tag_name` is specified then it will use the latest release.

* ### `tag_name` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
  The tag of a release. If `releaseId` is provided then this value will be ignored.  
  **Note:** If no `releaseId` nor `tag_name` is specified then it will use the latest release.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Mode: `update` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
Use this mode to create/edit releases. Also this mode allows you to upload assets to the release.

Since `v1.1.2` you have the option of replacing existing assets by setting `replace_assets` to `true`. With this option set, if you're going to edit a release and an asset name in that release matches one of your assets specified via the `assets` input then the existant asset will be deleted from the release so the new asset can be uploaded. Basically replaces the old asset with the new one provided. Without setting this option, the default behavior is for the action to fail if you try to upload assets that already exist.

### Inputs:

  * ### `assets` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
    > <file_expresion>[;<file_expresion>...;<file_expresion>]  
    >  
    > <file_expresion> := <file_path>  
    > <file_expresion> := <file_path>|<mime_type>
    > * **file_path** - Path where the file is located.  
    > * **mime_type** - A valid [MIME type][] of the file that will be uploaded.  

    A string indicating the path of the file(s) that you want to upload. You can upload one or multiple files by using the character `;` as separator.

    Since the [Github Api](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#upload-a-release-asset) requires to indicate the [MIME type][] of each file you want to upload, the action will try to infer the [MIME type][] based on the extension (it uses [mime-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime-types)'s lookup method). If the file has no extension or the extension cannot be associated to just one [MIME type][] then you need to speficy a [MIME type][].

    To specify a [MIME type][] you need to use the character `|` after the file path. 

    #### Examples:
    * Single file
      ```yaml
      # Will upload file README.md that is located at the current working directory.
      # The MIME type will be inferred.
      assets: README.md
      ```
      Single file with [MIME type][]
      ```yaml
      # Will upload file LICENSE but since it has no extension we specify the MIME type as 'text/plain'
      assets: LICENSE|text/plain
      ```
    * Multiple files
      ```yaml
      # Will upload assets README.md, myfile.zip and cat.png that are located at
      # the current working directory 
      assets: README.md;myfile.zip;cat.png
      ```
    * Multiple files with different [MIME type][]
      ```yaml
      # Will upload 3 files:
      #     - File LICENSE inside 'myFolder/' folder using the MIME type 'text/plain'
      #     - File myfile.zip at the current working directory with MIME type inferred
      #     - File myBinaryFile inside 'anotherFolder/' folder using the MIME type 'application/octet-stream'
      assets: myFolder/LICENSE|text/plain;myfile.zip;anotherFolder/myBinaryFile|application/octet-stream
      ```
  * ### `releaseId` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
    âš  _This value is required if no `tag_name` is provided._

    Id of the release that you want to edit. If `releaseId` then `tag_name` will be ignored.

  * ### `tag_name` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
    âš   _This value is required if no `releaseId` is provided._

    Tag that will be used to edit/create the release. If a release with the tag name provided already exists then the release will be edited otherwise it will create a release associated to that tag.

    While creating a release, if the provided tag doesn't exists then it will create the tag too.
  * ### `release_name` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
    Indicates the name of the release. If this value is not provided then the value of `tag_name` will be used instead.

  * ### `initial_mrkdwn` <sup>since v1.1.2</sup>
    Description that you want for your release, if the release does not already exist. This can be markdown syntax. Default value is the value of `body_mrkdwn` if that is also set, or `Release based on tag **${tag_name}**. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰` if neither is set.

  * ### `body_mrkdwn` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
    Description that you want for your release even if it already exists. This can be markdown syntax. If you omit this, an existing release description will not  be modified.

  * ### `isDraft` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
    Set this value to `true` if you want this release to be flagged as a draft.  
    **Note:** _a draft release won't generate any tags._

  * ### `isPrerelease` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
    Set this value to `true` if you want this release to be flagged as a prerelease.

  * ### `replace_assets` <sup>since v1.1.2</sup>
    Set this value to `true` if you want to be able to replace assets that already exist in the release, otherwise they will be considered errors.


### Outputs
It will expose the id of the created/edited release using the name `releaseId`.

  * ### `releaseId` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
    It will expose the id of the created/edited release using the name `releaseId`.

    Example:
    ```yaml
          - name: It should create a release with assets README.md and LICENCE
            id: hello
            uses: Xotl/cool-github-releases@v1
            with:
              mode: update
              tag_name: v3.2.1
              github_token: ${{ github.token }}
            
            # Use the output from the `hello` step
            - name: Get the output releaseId
              run: echo "The releaseId is ${{ steps.hello.outputs.releaseId }}"
    ```

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Mode: `delete` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
Deletes a release by tag or id.  
**Note:** tag associated to that release won't be deleted.

### Inputs:

  * ### `releaseId` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
    âš   _This value is required if no `tag_name` is provided._

    Id of the release that you want to delete. If `releaseId` is provided then `tag_name` will be ignored.

  * ### `tag_name` <sup>since v1.0.7</sup>
